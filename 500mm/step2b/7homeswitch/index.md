<h3>Attach Home Switch to X-Carriage</h3>

<b>Don't forget to do this before you put the X-Carriage onto the makerslide rail!</b> If you ordered your kit with home switches, you'll want to install the limit switch for the X-Carriage at this point. You'll need 2x M2x14mm socket head cap screws, 2x M2 split ring washers, 2x M2 nuts, and a single microswitch from your kit.  Put a split washer on each screw and insert them into the respective holes on the switch and x-carriage. Remember to position the switch so that the roller actuator is facing down and to the outside. Secure each screw with an M2 nut. You'll need a 1.5mm hex key for the screw and a small pair of pliers to hold the M2 nut. If you happen to have a 4mm wrench or socket you can also use that.
