  <h3>Insert Button into Enclosure</h3>

  **Line up the notch in the enclosure with the break in the threads**, placing the Emergency Stop ring between the button and enclosure.  This break in the threads should be on the side of the button marked **"Top"**.  The "Top" side of the button will correspond with the "Top" side of the screw terminals when reassembling.

  <h3>Secure Button with Nut</h3>

  Screw on the nut to secure the button to the enclosure.  If you're having problems tightening the nut try using the button itself, making sure to keep the break in the threads aligned.
