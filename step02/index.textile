You'll need these parts to assemble the X Carriage:

|\3{color:#fff;background: #383838}. **Core Components Kit** |
| **SKU** | **Name** | **Quantity** |
| 30545-01 | X Carriage Extrusion | 1 |
| 25197-04 | Smooth Idler Wheel Kit | 2 |
| 25203-04 | Dual Bearing V-Wheel Kit | 8 |
| 30552-01 | Flat Head Socket Cap Screw M5 x 35mm | 2 |
| 25286-21 | Button Head Cap Screw M5 x 25mm | 8 |
| 30265-04 | Nylon Insert Lock Nut M5 | 6 |
| 30158-01 | Eccentric Nut M5 | 4 |
| 25287-08 | Flat Washer M5 | 8 |
| 25312-23 | Aluminum Spacer 5.1mm ID 9.5mm OD 9.5mm LG | 2|

<h3 id="smooth-idlers">1. Smooth Idlers</h3>

The first thing you’ll do is attach the smooth idlers. Insert one of the flat head screws like this:

!https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/473/original/0009.jpg?1423589578!

Next you’ll put a spacer onto the screw followed by the smooth idler and a nylock hex nut. Tighten the hex nut with moderate force.

<div class="row">

</div>

_Note: make sure the side of the Smooth Idler with the protruding bearing is installed next to the aluminum spacer.  If not, the plastic portion of the Smooth Idler may get in the way of the screws used to mount your stepper motor._

Repeat this process with the other smooth idler.

<h3 id="v-wheels">2. V-Wheels</h3>

Next you’ll be attaching the V-Wheels. There will be eight V-Wheels on the X Carriage, four of them will be attached with nylock nuts and the other four will be attached with eccentric nuts. The holes for the eccentric nuts are larger.

h4. V-Wheels with Nylock Nuts

Start by attaching one of the top four V-Wheels with nylock nuts. You’ll insert a 25mm button head cap screw into this hole on the X Carriage. 

!https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/642/original/0028.jpg?1424455895!

Next slide a washer over the screw, followed by a V-Wheel and a nylock hex nut. Tighten the nut with moderate force.

!(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/643/original/0029.jpg?1424455896! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/644/original/0030.jpg?1424455897! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/645/original/0034.jpg?1424455914! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/646/original/0035.jpg?1424455915!

Repeat that three times and your X Carriage will look like this:

!https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/535/original/0868.jpg?1424362473!

h4. V-Wheels with Eccentric Nuts

Next you’ll attach the bottom V-Wheels with eccentric nuts. These nuts have a "shoulder" on them which is designed to be seated in various holes on your X-Carve.

!https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/488/span4/Eccentric%20Nut.jpg?1423759789!

You'll need to adjust them later so put a V-Wheel and then a washer onto a screw and insert it into the X Carriage from the inside. 

!https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/483/original/0050.jpg?1423679351!

Thread the eccentric nut onto the screw making sure the “shoulder” is facing the X Carriage. Be sure to seat the shoulder in the hole on the X Carriage and tighten the screw with moderate force.

!(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/652/original/0050.jpg?1424456639! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/654/original/0052.jpg?1424456640! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/656/original/0054.jpg?1424456642! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/657/original/0063.jpg?1424456688!

Repeat this process for the remaining three V-Wheels. When you're done your X Carriage should look like this:

!https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/478/original/0073.jpg?1423590562!

<h3 id="eccentric-nuts">3. Positioning of Eccentric Nuts</h3>

The eccentric nuts on your X-Carve are a slick little example of good engineering. By rotating the nut you can change the position of the screw it captures. You'll use these to adjust the position of V-Wheels all over the machine. Before going any further take a minute to position the eccentric nuts on the X Carriage to the “open” position. In this position the screw that is held by the nut is down and as far away from the top V-wheels as possible. When we refer to an eccentric nut being in the open position it will always be as far away from a static V-Wheel as possible. Here’s a photo that illustrates this concept:

<h3 id="motor-mounting">4. Motor Mounting</h3>

Choose your motor type:

  <div class="panel panel-default">
    <a data-toggle="collapse" data-parent="#motor-accordion" href="#nema17" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="nema17" class="panel-heading" role="tab" id="nema17-header">

| 25285-32 | Socket Head Cap Screw M3 x 10mm | 3 |
| 25287-10 | Flat Washer M3 | 3 |

Start this step by putting a pulley on your NEMA 17 stepper motor. You will use two set screws to hold it in place. Slide it on so the edge is flush with the end of the motor shaft and tighten the screws just enough to hold it in place.

Your NEMA 17 motor has tapped holes to accept screws, take a moment to locate them. You'll use three of the four on the motor. Orient the motor as shown with the wires pointing up and to the right:

!(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/678/original/1300.jpg?1424463225! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/672/original/1297.jpg?1424463007! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/673/original/1298.jpg?1424463010! !(thumbnail col-md-3)https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/674/original/1303.jpg?1424463013!

Put a washer on each screw and insert them  from the opposite side of the X Carriage using the access holes. You may find it easier to start the screws by inserting them from the side of the carriage and then tightening them through the access holes. Tighten these screws with moderate force.

The NEMA 23 mounting holes on the X Carriage are tapped. Simply insert the screws through the motor housing and screw them into the X Carriage. Get all of the screws finger tight and then tighten them in an x-pattern with moderate force . Be sure to orient the wires of your stepper motor towards the bottom of the X Carriage.
