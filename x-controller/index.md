Welcome to the X-Controller assembly instructions! The images shown at the beginning of each step show the finished results of that step. This is to provide context for what you're about to start working on, and offer those eager and willing to figure things out on their own a way to skim through more quickly. Make sure to click on the thumbnails to see more details.</p>

<p>
Each step also begins with a bill of materials that details the components about to be used. To avoid any frustration you might have from finding out that something's missing, we've laid out the bill of materials here so you can find out now before you even get going. Click below to reveal the BOM and make sure you received everything correctly. If there's anything missing please contact us at help @ inventables.com for replacements.</p>

<h3>
1. Attach Feet (OPTIONAL)</h3>
 <img src="PB231229BATCH019.jpg">

<p>
Attach the four rubber "feet" to the bottom of the chassis. Flip the chassis over and twist the foot through the hole. Once the foot is partially in, try using your fingernail to bring it the rest of the way through. This is an optional step and the holes can also be used to mount the chassis to a work table.</p>

<h3>
2. Prepare Enclosed Power Supply</h3>
 <img src="P1151511EDIT.jpg">

<p>
This is a universal power supply capable of running at 110V or 220V. Flip the toggle switch on the side of the power supplys to the voltage that correspondes to your [outlet voltage.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_electricity_by_country#Table_of_mains_voltages_and_frequencies</p>)

<h3>
3. Attach Power Supply Interface PCB</h3>
 <img src="PB231244BATCH034.jpg">

<p>
Flip the orange cover back and remove the screws on the enclosed power supply that correspond to the "fingers" on the power supply interface PCB. Attach the power supply interface PCB and reinstall the screws to secure it in place.</p>

<h3>
4. Attach Power Supply to Chassis</h3>
 <img src="PB231247BATCH037.jpg">

<p>
Using the M4 x 8mm button head cap screws, attach the power supply through the mounting holes on the underside of the chassis. The threaded holes on the base of the power supply are delicate, so try not to overtighten the screws when assembling.

</p>
<div class="note">

1. Prepare Controller Board</h3>
 <img src="PB231254EDIT.jpg">

<p>
Unless you're an advanced user looking to make some tweaks or want an easy way to use your X-Controller without re-wiring your machine, you won't need to make any adjustments. That being said, in order for the Grbl firmware to know how far the machine will move in reality, a few things need to be set on the controller board. Microstepping is one of these settings and allows the motors to move to positions between normal steps; increasing accuracy and smoothing the motion of the motor. Depending on the capabilites of the motors, there does come a point where the microstepping will no longer increase accuracy. Using high microstep values (e.g 16) can reduce stepper motor torque, so it's best to use the lowest value that can still give you the axes resolution you're looking for. Dip switches on the main controller board allow you to set the microstepping. Make sure to check out the diagram on the board for propper placement of the switches.</p>

<p>
Idle current reduction is another feature that can be set on the controller board. This setting automatically reduces the amount of current shortly after the motor stops moving, reducing heat from the driver and the motor. This feature is especially great for the Z axis which spends a lot of its time idle. You can set this using the dip switches, just make sure to again check out the diagram for proper placement.</p>

<p>
The potentiometers on the controller board allow you to control the maximum current to the motors. Clockwise increases the current and counter-clockwise decreases the current. Current ratings are different for NEMA 17 (1.6A) and NEMA 23 (2.8A) stepper motors and need to be set accordingly. The slot between the dots on the gray actuator is the pointer, and can be adjusted based on the diagram on the controller board.</p>

<p>
For those users who would like to know the current more precisely, you can measure the amount of voltage on the reference and ground test points. Use the formula </p>

 <strong>Note:</strong> For those of you wanting a quick an easy way to start using your X-Carve without re-wiring your machine, simply turn the Y axis potentiometer all the way up (4A). For other usage options, check out our <a href="http://x-carve-instructions.inventables.com/x-controller/usage/">usage instructions</a>. You can always change this in the future, but with access to the main controller board now, it's a good time to decide which route to take.

2. Attach Stops</h3>
 <img src="PB231250BATCH040.jpg">

<p>
Install the M4 button head cap screws in the threaded holes on the side of the chassis. These screws locate the back of the controller board and make the face of the board flush with the chassis.</p>

<h3>
3. Wire Controller Board</h3>
 <img src="PB231284BATCH073.jpg">

<p>
Attach the cables to the power supply interface PCB. The cables can only be connected in one orientation, so if they don't attach well double check them and try again. Try to orient them so that the wires can easily travel from board to board.</p>

<p>
Remove the button from the screw terminals by gently pulling on the yellow tab. With the button upside down (as pictured) pull the tab towards you and then to the right to disengage the two parts. Unscrew the nut attached to the base of the button. This nut will be used to secure the button to the enclosure.</p>

Loosen the phillips head screws on the screw terminals and attach the ends of the e-stop cable to each side of the NC screw terminal as pictured. Tighten the screws on the screw terminals to hold the cable in place. To attach the wired screw terminal to the button, <strong>line up the "TOP" marking on the button with the "TOP" marking on the screw terminal.</strong> Once in postion, move the yellow tab towards the back of the assembly to lock in place.

<p>
Attach the fan cable to the power supply interface PCB. The cable can only be connected in one orientation, so if it doesn't attach well double check and try again. <strong>Check the ribbon cable connector at the power supply interface PCB</strong> and attach the back panel using the included M4 socket head cap screws. You may need to wiggle the lower PCB in place when installing to have the back panel flush with the chassis.</p>
