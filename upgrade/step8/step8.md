<p> Start by powering off the X-Controller and disconnecting the green terminal blocks. You'll need to remove the sideboard and loosen the screws holding down the drag chain. 

If you have the dust shoe installed, detach the dust shoe from the z-axis and raise the pole arm out of the bracket. Set this aside to reinstall later.<br> </p>

    <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
     <span class="note-text">
     <strong>Note: Make sure the X-Controller is completely powered off. Failure to disconnect stepper motors will damage the electronics. </strong>
     </span>
  </div>

<p> Loosen the button head cap screws that hold the wasteboard down to the frame. There are two screws in the center and 12 around the edges. You will <b>not</b> need these screws later. </p>

<img src="photos/IMG_6311(2).jpg"> <br>

<p>Once all the screws are removed, slide the wasteboard forward to remove. Set aside. </p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6312.JPG">
<img src="photos/IMG_6313.JPG">

<p>Loosen the button head cap screws and remove the gusset brackets from the middle extrusion. Set this extrusion and hardware aside, you will <b>not</b> need these components.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6314(2).jpg">

<p>Loosen and remove the lower socket head cap screws on the risers or front plates. There are 2 on each plate, total of 8 screws. Set the hardware aside, you <b>will</b> need this hardware later. </p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6317(2).jpg">

<p>Loosen the button head cap screws that secure the Stiffener Panels to the wasteboard and to the makerslide. Remove the stiffeners from both sides. Set the hardware aside, you <b>will</b> need this hardware later. </p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6321.JPG">
<img src="photos/IMG_6324.JPG">

<p>Loosen the gusset brackets on all 4 corners of the frame. Keep 2 gusset brackets with pre-assembly t-slot nuts loosely threaded. Set remaining hardware aside, you <b>will</b> need this hardware later. </p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6324(2).jpg">

<p>Once the base of the wasteboard base is separated, start assembling the Modular Waste Board Kit by aligning two 20mm x 20mm extrusions. Use M5 x 10mm button head cap screw and M5 pre-assembly t-slot nuts on the gusset bracket.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6327(1).png">

<p>Use one waste board extrusion and one waste board tee track to set the correct location of the 1000mm rail.   Then use a 3mm hex to secure the extrusion bracket. Alternatively, you can set this spacing by measuring 1.25" / 32mm.</p>
<img src="photos/alignextrusion.gif">

<p>Thread 3 M5 x 12mm Button Head Cap Screws into 3 M5 Pre-Assembly T-Slot Nuts. Slide 2 screw assemblies into the 1000mm extrusion and 1 into the 958mm extrusion. You will have to slide it into the 958mm extrusion from the back.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6330.JPG">

<h3>Attach the First MDF Slat</h3>
<p>Align the first wasteboard slat with the edges of the base extrusions and slide screws into place. Secure by tightneing the three screws. </p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6335(1).png">

<p>Gather the 2 silver 20mm x 20mm x 898mm extrusions, 3 M5 x 12 Button Head Cap Screws and 3 M5 Pre-Assembly T-Slot Nuts.</p>

<p>Thread the M5 x 12mm Button Head Cap Screws into the M5 Pre-Assembly T-Slot Nuts. Slide 2 of them on to the top silver 20mm x 20mm 898mm extrusion and 1 to the middle silver extrusion (shown below). </p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6337(1).jpg">

<p>Slide the screw assemblies in place and align the extrusions with the first MDF slat holes. Tighten down the button head cap screws (shown below).</p>

<img src="photos/IMG_6341.JPG">

<h3>Assemble t-tracks</h3>
<p>Gather the Tee Track Extrusions (3), M4 x 10mm Button Head Cap Screws (6), M4 Nylon Insert Lock Nut (6), Oversize Washer (6).</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6344.JPG">
<p>Each section of tee track has 5 holes drilled in it. We will be installing oversized washers on the <b>second</b> and <b>fourth</b> holes, as shown below.</p>
<img scr="photos/IMG_6346.JPG">
<img src="photos/teetrackwashers.PNG">
<p>Use a 2.5mm allen to insert the M4 x 10mm button head screw into the appropriate hole of the tee track. Add an oversized washer onto the screw, then an M4 Nylock nut.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_4152.jpg">
<img src="photos/IMG_4156.jpg">
<p>Tighten using your 2.5mm hex key with a 7mm wrench.  Repeat this for the second and fourth hole in each of the three tee tracks.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6346.JPG">

<h3> Install first t-track</h3>
<p>Attach one M4 pre-assembly t-slot nut (25281-16) into the top slot of each of the 3 extrusions that run side to side.</p>
<img src="photos/Capture2.PNG">
<p>Place the tee track on top of the extrusions and thread an M4 x 8mm screw through the t-track and into each tee nut. Start with the black extrusion in the front. You may need to move the silver extrusions in order to line up the tee nuts with the holes in the t-track.</p>
<img src="photos/ezgif.com-gif-maker (6).gif">
<img src="photos/ezgif.com-gif-maker (7).gif">
<p>Slide the t-track extrusion to be against the MDF slat.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6348.JPG">

<h3>Install second MDF slat</h3>
<p>Thread 2 M5 x 12mm Button Head Cap Screws into 2 M5 Pre-Assembly T-Slot Nuts. Two will go to the rear extrusion.</p> 
<img src="photos/IMG_6352(1).jpg">
<p>Slide 2 M5 Pre-Assembly T-Slot Nuts into the middle extrusion and another 2 on the lowest extrusion. </p>
<img src="photos/2ndslat.jpg">
<p> Align the 2 screws on the rear silver extrusion to the spacing on the waste board slat, and slide the slat onto the screws.
Align the front of the waste board slat to the two pre-assembly t-slot nuts in the black extrusion (pictured above). Thread two M5 x 12mm button head cap screws through that waste board slat and into the M5 pre-assembly t-slot nuts.</p>

<p>Push the second MDF slat against the tee track. <b>We will tighten these screws at the end, for now it is best to leave them a bit loose.</b></p>

<h3>Install remaining t-slot track and MDF slats</h3>
<p>Follow the same steps as before, install the second t-slot and MDF slat.</p>
<p>Use M4 pre-assembly t-slot nuts (25281-16) into the top slot of each of the 3 extrusions that run side to side.</p>

<img src="photos/IMG_6356.JPG">
<p>Slide the t-slot track against the MDF slat and secure without fully tightening.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6357.JPG">
<p>Use M5 x 12mm socket head cap screws and M5 Pre-Assembly T-Slot Nuts to align and loosely secure the 3rd MDF slat (shown below).</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6360.JPG">
<img src="photos/IMG_6361.JPG">
<p>Install the last t-track using 3 M4 pre-assembly t-slot nuts (25281-16) into the top slot of each of the 3 extrusions that run side to side.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6363.JPG">
<h3>Install the fourth MDF Slat</h3>
<p>Use M5 x 12mm button head cap screws and M5 pre-assembly t-slot nuts to align the fourth MDF Slat. Two on the top silver extrusion, one in the middle extrusion and two on the lower black extrusion. </p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6365.JPG">
<p>Attach two M5 x 10mm button head cap screws and M5 pre-assembly t-slot nuts to a gusset bracket. Secure a gusset bracket to the lower corner of the 958mm extrusion. Also, slide in an M5 x 12mm button head cap screw with the pre-assembly t-slot nut to the top of the rail.</p>
<img src="photos/958mmextrusion.jpg">
<p> Align the extrusion with the edge of the MDF slat, and then tighten the middle M5x12mm button head cap screw that secures the MDF slat to the extrusion. You will tightnen the gusset bracket in a later step.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6367(1).jpg">
<p>Once all MDF slats and t-tracks are installed, slide all the waste board parts together. Line up the front of each panel with the front edge of the black extrusion. Repeat for all four MDF slats and secure each panel in place.</p>
<img src="photos/allslats.jpg">

<h3>Install rear 1000mm extrusion</h3>

<p> Gather 4 gusset brackets, 8 M5 x 10mm socket head cap screws, 6 M5 pre-assembly t-slot nuts, 4 M5 tee nut twist in and the 20mm x 20mm x 1000mm extrusion.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6371.JPG">
<p>Pull the gantry forward and work on the back of the machine. Attach an gusset bracket to each of the two 958mm extrusions sticking out. Insert 1 pre-assembly t-slot nut into the top channel of each 958mm extrusion. </p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6376(1).jpg">
<p>Secure the rear 1000mm extrusion by tightening the angle brackets.</p>
<img src="photos/secure958mm.jpg">
<p>Attach 2 M5 x 10mm button head cap screws and 2 M5 tee nut twist in to each remaining gusset bracket (image below shows only 1). These will be used to secure the rear silver extrusion to the 958mm extrusions.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_4477.jpg">
<img src="photos/IMG_4478.jpg">
<p>Tighten down screws to lock gusset brackets in place. Your back board frame should look like this.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_4480.jpg">
<p>Prepare to install the MDF backboard by sliding 3 M5 pre-assembly t-slot nuts to the 1000mm extrusion. Space them out to line up with the backboard holes.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_4487.jpg">
<img src="photos/IMG_4490.jpg">
<p>Use M5 x 12mm screws and two washers to secure the MDF backboard to the extrusions.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_4496.jpg">
<img src="photos/IMG_4497.jpg">

<h3>Install threaded inserts</h3>
<p>The wasteboard assembly is now completely. Carefully slide wasteboard off the table and flip it over. <b>You may need to use a separate table or ask someone to hold the X-Carve in place to avoid knocking it off.</b></p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6383.JPG">
<img src="photos/IMG_6385.JPG">
<p>Use the 5mm hex driver bit and a drill to install threaded inserts into the holes.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6386.JPG">
<p>Using 2 gusset brackets, 4 M5 X 12mm button head cap screws and 4 M5 tee nut twist in, secure the middle extrusion.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_4513.jpg">

<p>Tighten all of the gusset brackets down. Carefully slide off wasteboard, flip it and slide under the X-Carve. Locate the 8 M5 x 10mm socket head cap screws and M5 pre-assembly t-slot nuts that secure the risers to the extrusions. These were uninstalled at the beginning.</p>
<img src="photos/IMG_6389.JPG">

<p>Before tightening down the socket head cap screws, make sure your wasteboard is squared by measuring diagonally.</p>

<img src="photos/IMG_6394.JPG">
<img src="photos/IMG_6395.JPG">

<p>Slide in pre-assembly t-slot nuts and line them up with the bottom holes on the risers. Tighten the X-Carve down to the wasteboard. </p>

<p>Once the wasteboard is secured, locate the stiffener plates and attach to the sides of the X-Carve extrusion and makerslides.</p>
