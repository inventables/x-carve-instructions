<h3> Riser Installation </h3>
If you are using the Inventables Dust Collection System, start by removing the dust hose boom and sitting aside.
IMG_2530.HEIC	
Support the gantry using stacked books, materials, boxes, etc.  5 layers of ¾” thick material works well.
IMG_2511.HEIC	
Remove the stock front and back plates. Be sure to put the belt clip lock nuts in a safe place - we will be reusing them.   
IMG_2520.HEIC
IMG_2513.HEIC
Raise the gantry approximately 2” by adding additional support under the gantry.   A total of 8 layers of ¾” material works well.
IMG_2523.HEIC
Install the upgraded risers using the included hardware.  It is easiest to start the tee nuts on their screws, and then slide them into the extrusion.  Be sure to reinstall the belt clip tensioner lock nuts that you set aside earlier.
IMG_2531.HEIC
IMG_2532.HEIC
IMG_2524.HEIC

If you are using the Inventables Dust Collection system, install the pole support bracket as shown:
IMG_2529.HEIC
IMG_2528.HEIC
IMG_2530.HEIC

Now is a good time to ensure that your Y axis rails are properly aligned to your wasteboard.   If you hold a square against the rails, there should be approximately ⅛” overhang on each side.  To slide the rails left or right, loosen the bottom 2 screws on all 4 risers.   Align and tighten.

Stiffener Installation:
Peel the protective film from both sides of the stiffener panels
IMG_2536.HEIC
IMG_2537.HEIC
Prefit the hardware on the panels as shown.  The hardware should be loose at this point.
Fit the panels in place using the drop in tee nuts.   Make sure that all 6 nuts are in place before tightening each panel.   Install 4 panels on each side.

IMG_2547.HEIC

Z Axis installation:
Unplug the Z axis stepper motor and homing switch
IMG_2548.HEIC
IMG_2550.HEIC
Remove the router from the router mount - it can sit behind the gantry for now
IMG_2551.HEIC
IMG_2552.HEIC
Remove the stock Z axis assembly by loosening the 4 screws at the back of the Z.
IMG_2554.HEIC


Transfer the homing switch from the stock Z to the Upgraded Z.   You will reuse the homing switch mounting hardware.
IMG_2555.HEIC
IMG_2559.HEIC
Remove the 2 bolts that attach the stock delrin nut to the spindle mount on the stock Z axis.   This will allow you to remove the router mount by sliding it downward.
IMG_2561.HEIC
IMG_2562.HEIC
Remove the Z wheels and hardware from the router mount
IMG_2563.HEIC
IMG_2564.HEIC
Bolt the router mount to the new Z Axis using (4) M5 x 16 socket head screws and (4) M5 flat washers from the Z axis hardware kit
IMG_2565.HEIC
IMG_2566.HEIC
If you are using the Inventables Dust Collection system, remove the dust shoe arms from the stock Z axis.  Remove the green screws and replace with the black knobs from the kit.   Install the dust shoe arms on the new Z axis.
IMG_2568.HEIC
IMG_2569.HEIC
The upgrade kit includes a Z probe relocation kit.   If you already have one installed or if you do not have a Z probe, you can skip this step.   Otherwise, install the Z probe relocation kit using the included hardware.
IMG_2571.HEIC
Install the Z axis on the gantry.   You can reuse the (4) screws that mounted the stock Z, or use the replacements included in the kit.  For short bits or thin work, mount the Z a little below the bottom of the X-Carriage.   For longer bits or thick workpieces, mount the bottom of the Z flush with the bottom of the X-Carriage.  Tighten the (4) screws from the back to secure the Z.
IMG_2576.HEIC
IMG_2573.HEIC
IMG_2575.HEIC
IMG_2578.HEIC
Install the router in the router mount and tighten the 3 clamping screws.
IMG_2579.HEIC
IMG_2587.HEIC
For the Z axis stepper and homing switch wires, you will need all the extra wire to be on the Z axis end of the drag chains.   Work carefully to work the slack through the drag chains to get as much wire as possible available.   You may need to adjust the drag chains slightly to get enough slack.
Adjusting drag chain to get more wire slack:
Move the X-Carriage to its furthest right position
Loosen the 2 screws that hold the lower end of the X axis drag chain to the 2020 drag chain support extrusion
Pull the end of the drag chain to the left, as shown:

Tighten the 2 screws on the drag chain end
Plug in the Z axis homing switch and stepper motor
IMG_2581.HEIC
Apply the included Inventables sticker to the top of the Z axis
IMG_2589.HEIC
