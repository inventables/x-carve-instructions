<h3 id="insert-flanged-bearing">1. Insert Flanged Bearing</h3>

Insert the flanged bearing into the Z-Plate as shown. Be sure to insert the bearing from the side of the plate that has a recession, the bearing will sit inside the hole so that the flange is flush with the Z-Plate.

Insert two small screws to hold the bearing captive. Finger tighten both and check to make sure the flange is flush with the Z-Plate. Then tighten them down with moderate force.

<h3 id="attach-z-plate">2. Attach the Z-Plate to the Z-Axis Makerslide</h3>

Before you attach the Z-Axis Makerslide to the Z-Plate be sure that you have the correct orientation:

<div class="note">
  <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
  <span class="note-text">
    Note: The flange on the bearing is facing down and the rails of the Makerslide are facing forward.
  </span>
</div>

Use two self tapping screws to attach the Z-Plate to the Z-Axis Makerslide. The screws go through the Z-Plate and into the Makerslide. Be sure to keep constant pressure along the hole you're tapping.

When you're done your Z-Axis should look like this:

<h3 id="attach-z-axis">3. Attach the Z-Axis to the X Carriage</h3>

| 25281-05 | T-Slot Nut M5 Pre-Assembly | 4 |
| 25286-18 | Button Head Cap Screw M5 x 10mm | 4 |

Push two screws through the top  Z-Axis mounting holes on the X Carriage.

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/549/original/0524.jpg?1424378647!

Thread two insertion nuts onto these screws. You'll only need a couple of threads to grab.

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/551/original/0527.jpg?1424378704!

The backside of the Z-Axis Makerslide has two slots that are designed to accept insertion nuts. Slide these slots over the insertion nuts.

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/552/original/0533.jpg?1424378767!

Slide the Z-Axis down along the X Carriage to about here and tighten:

Rock the machine onto its front like this:

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/554/original/0539.jpg?1424378866!

Insert two more insertion nuts from the bottom of the Z-Axis and finger tighten two screws into them to secure the Z-Axis Makerslide:

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/559/original/0544.jpg?1424378949!

The Z-Axis should be captured by four insertion nuts and screws at this point, but you should still be able to slide it up and down the X Carriage. Slide it so that the insertion nuts are just inside of the Makerslide like this:

p=. !https://dzevsq2emy08i.cloudfront.net/paperclip/project_instruction_image_uploaded_images/560/original/0546.jpg?1424379091!

<div class="note">
  <i class="fa fa-hand-o-right"></i>
  <span class="note-text">
    Note: The bottom of the Z-Axis will not be flush with the X Carriage, it will protrude slightly.
  </span>
</div>

Tighten all four screws that capture the Z-Axis. Alternate between screws in an x-pattern to maintain alignment.

Rock the machine back on to its feet again to continue:
