In this step you'll be mounting a DeWalt 611 router in the spindle mount. Begin by removing existing base and collar from the spindle. This will leave just the metal router body.

Use a screwdriver or other prying tool to gently pry the spindle mount open and insert the router until the yellow button shows through on the bottom of the spindle mount.

Tighten the three M4x16mm screws to hold the router in place.

The router power cable will be put in the drag chains alongside the stepper motor cables in the next step. The router is powered with a simple AC wall outlet.
