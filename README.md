[X-Carve Instructions](http://x-carve-instructions.inventables.com/)
=========================

This is the official documentation for assembling [X-Carve](https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve/), a 3D carving kit from [Inventables](https://www.inventables.com/). Like X-Carve itself, these instructions are open-source. 

If you have experience with Github, feel free to fork this branch and submit a pull request. The instructions are built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and are formatted using [Textile](http://redcloth.org/textile) (with some HTML mixed in).

It's also possible to suggest changes through Github itself. Each step of the instructions is generated from a file named ```index.textile```, contained inside the folder for that step (eg ```step02/index.textile```). The one exception is the file for the first step, which is ```index.textile``` inside the main ```x-carve-instructions``` folder.

Find the ```index.textile``` file for the step you'd like to edit, and click the pencil icon in the top right. This will let you fork a branch and make changes right in the browser. You can then submit a pull request to have your changes reviewed and integrated. [Learn more about pull requests here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). 

If you prefer, you can also submit a Github issue using the menu to the right:
