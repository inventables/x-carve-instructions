<h3 id="attach-end-plates">1. Attach End Plates to Makerslide</h3>

You’re going to use self tapping screws again. This time you'll attach a piece of Makerslide to an end plate. Make sure you use the correct holes in the end plate and that you orient the two pieces correctly.

**If you have limit switches, make sure the slot on the Makerslide is oriented in the upper position.**  This slot is used to attach the limit switch "actuator" and will not be aligned with the switch if the Makerslide is positioned incorrectly.

    Note: You want to make sure that the rails of the Makerslide are on the flat side of the end plate and that you leave one hole open on the top side of the end plate.

Repeat this process with another piece of Makerslide and another end plate, but mirror the piece you made in the previous step. You should have two pieces like this:

<h3 id="slide-on-gantry">2. Slide on Gantry</h3>

Now you’ll slide the gantry onto each of the Y-axes. This step is just like when you put the X Carriage onto the x-axis. Go slow and check the orientation of the eccentric nuts on the Y-Plates if you are encountering resistance.

<h3 id="add-insertion-nuts">3. Add Insertion Nuts for Belt Clips</h3>

Put two insertion nuts into each piece of y-axis Makerslide (four in total).

<h3 id="attach-front-end-plates">4. Attach Front End Plates</h3>

Now put the last two end plates on the y-axis Makerslide with self tapping screws. The flat sides of the end plates should face out:

Your X-Carve should look like this:

You’ll connect the two y-axes with extrusions in the front and back of the machine.

Slide the insertion nuts into the extrusions and fasten the end plates to them with 8mm screws:
